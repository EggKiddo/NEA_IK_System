# NEA_IK_System
An Inverse Kinematics solver using the Jacobian Inverse and Jacobian Transpose method.
This was the code for my NEA project, but due to COVID-19 and cancellation of all exams, I'm no longer hesitant to upload it.
Make sure you have the PeasyCam library installed for Processing

## Warning:
It is by no means a good implementation of the two algorithms, and user interaction is admittedly awful, but I didn't have time to polish it.
